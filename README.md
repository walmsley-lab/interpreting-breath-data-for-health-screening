# Interpreting breath data for health screening
An investigation into learning structured representations from breath-derived data to support interpretable health screening under realistic data constraints.

## Overview

This project puls in a kaggle dataset with breath samples and trains a model on the data.  In the future I would like to expand to more data sample sources. With enough data features will begin to emerge and can be associated with dissease. See the notebook for details.

## Running

This project was impelmented in pytorch. It is run with Python from the Juypeter Notebook.
